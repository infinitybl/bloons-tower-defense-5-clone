# bloons-tower-defense-5-clone
This is a clone of the Ocean Road track in the Bloons Tower Defense 5 game created in Java with the Java Swing library for the user interface.
There are 85 total rounds in this track, each with unique combination of bloons, and I implemented in 14 different towers and all the bloon types from the original game.
You can check it out in the YouTube video below.

NOTE: I removed all asset files such as backgrounds, music and sprites using a .gitignore due to copyright
